# StickMUDSounds

This site hosts the sound files for StickMUD, many of which are 10 minute ambiences that play in the background as players move from area to area within the game.  The 10 minute ambiences are created by "Tabletop Audio" and are intended to be used from this website only for the purpose of supporting game play at the StickMUD text-based adventure game.
